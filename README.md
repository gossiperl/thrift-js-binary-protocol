# Apache Thrift BinaryProtocol for JavaScript

An implementation of TBinaryProtocol for JavaScript Thrift library.

## Why not part of Thrift?

The reason is described here: https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/345.

## Running tests

Tests require the `thrift.js` file to be placed in the the `test/deps` directory. The easiest way to obtain this file is to clone the [Thrift repository](https://github.com/apache/thrift) and copy the file from `lib/js/src/thrift.js` to deps folder. Then simply open the `test-binary.html` in the browser.

## Usage

`Thrift.BinaryProtocol` depends on `thrift` library being present.

    <script src="thrift.js"></script>
    <script src="thrift-js-binary-protocol.js"></script>
    <script>
      var transport = new Thrift.Transport("/dummy");
      var protocol  = new Thrift.TBinaryProtocol(transport);
      ...
    </script>

All methods of the standard `TBinaryProtocol` are implemented.
